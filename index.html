                        <p><strong>Bloom™ offers an exciting and powerful process of self-discovery</strong> that promotes healing and wholeness. Rose Meenach, a Cincinnati-based certified/licensed Transpersonal Hypnotherapist and founder of Bloom, utilizes a specialized form of Transpersonal Hypnotherapy called Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique (QHHT).
                        </p>
                        <p>Over recent decades, advances in Quantum Physics have yielded a growing body of evidence supporting the idea that the thoughts we have are what drive the reality we experience. Bloom uses QHHT to delve more deeply into our thoughts via our Subconscious mind and our Superconscious, or Higher Self, to <strong>identify opportunities for personal development, growth and wellness.</strong></p>
                        <p>In addition to individual applications, Bloom’s Transpersonal Hypnotherapy modalities when coupled with Mindfulness techniques have proven to be effective practices for the workplace. These methods continue to gain increased attention in corporate environments for improving Team-Building, Leadership Development, and opening minds to fuel Creative Innovation. Bloom offers practices to individuals and to organizations and corporate workplace groups.</p>

                        <h2>Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique</h2>
                        <p>Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique® (QHHT), was developed by Dolores Cannon over several decades with thousands of clients. It is considered the deepest level of hypnosis possible, and is also known as the Somnambulistic level of trance, usually experienced just prior to waking from a night’s sleep, or just before we fall asleep. Induced through deep relaxation and visualization techniques, individuals may relay past experiences from this life, or even from past lives, yielding insights for personal development in our present life.</p>
                        <p>It is a practice rooted not only in reincarnation, but also in surrendering to our greater, Higher Self, or our more knowing spiritual source—the superconscious. Extensive work by Ms. Cannon and others definitively conclude that we have all lived multiple past lives and that we all possess a subconscious mind and a superconscious capable of conveying answers to many of the questions we hold relative to this life, our relationships and our experiences.</p>

                        <h2>Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique</h2>
                        <p>Past Life Regression is a key component of QHHT® and involves one being “regressed” and guided through an appropriate past life. The superconscious will select which past life to show an individual as they are guided through the session. The past life selected is always relevant to one’s current life and it is not uncommon for multiple past lives to be shown during a single session. As a past life is engaged, a series of questions are asked to help determine the time period and social setting of that life.</p>

                        <h2>Sed ut perspiciatis undomix</h2>
                        <p>Our subconscious lies just beneath our conscious level of awareness and greatly impacts our thoughts and how we behave. It records everything we do and think. Our superconscious, or Higher Self, operates at an even higher level of awareness, a universal level that sees our bodies and lives in material reality, but it manifests in the very energy and consciousness underlying that reality.</p>
                        <p>It is believed we only use about 5% of our brains (or minds), consciously, in our day-to-day living, while the remaining 95% is housed in our subconscious. Our Higher Self superconscious extends outside of, and beyond our space/time continuum, as we know it. This concept may be extremely challenging to consider, at first, and requires stretching most people’s belief systems. But science continues to reveal that our thoughts have a direct, measurable effect on physical matter, and we know that matter is just different forms of energy vibrating at various frequencies.</p>
